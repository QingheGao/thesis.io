## Normalizing flow

Before we actually get into the normalizing flow, we need to discuss some concept of Jacobian.


### Jacobian matrix

Consider a simple transition:
```markdown
$$
\left[
 \begin{matrix}
   a & b & c & d & e\\
   f & g & h & i & j \\
   k & l & m & n & o \\
   p & q & r & s & t
  \end{matrix} 
\right]
$$

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/QingheGao/thesis.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
