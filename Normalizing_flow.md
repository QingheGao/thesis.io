## Normalizing flow

Before we actually get into the normalizing flow, we need to discuss some concept of Jacobian.


### Jacobian matrix

Consider a simple transition:
f([x,y]) = [x+sin(y), y+sin(x)]

We can see that this transition is quite complex and difficult to discuss. 

But this transition has an important property: Local linearly.

It is clear to see that local transition is linearly transform. Thus, we can use this property.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/QingheGao/thesis.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
